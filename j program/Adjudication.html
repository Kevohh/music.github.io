Music and arts requires some particular guidelines during competitions for correct and fair awarding and ranking of different groups of the competing groups. For this reason, there are some particular guidelines for adjudicators that would enable them give fair decisions on the compositions and the setpieces. Below are some of the guidelines:<br><br> 
<b><font size="6" color="red"> A.</font></b> Each adjudicator is employed to aid in a program of music education. The results of his/her judging
    can either be a help or a hindrance. Care should be exercised in the wording of comments in order
    that they may be detailed, constructive, and helpful.<font color="red"> Adjudicators shall avoid the use of sarcastic remarks
    . </font><font color="blue">The comments shall be detailed enough to qualify the rating remarks given in order that
    performers and directors may have sufficient suggestions to improve their work.</font><br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">B.</font></b>  School classification<font color="red"> shall not</font> be considered by adjudicators in assigning ratings for <font color="seafoam">solo and small ensemble</font> performances, but <b><u>should be</u></b> a consideration for <font color="lime">large conducted ensembles</font>. The
    adjudicators must keep in mind they are judging high school students and not college, university, or
    professional groups.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">C.</font></b> Adjudicators should be aware of specific event regulations. Please study to avoid any confusion
regarding acceptable or unacceptable performances.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">D.</font></b> The adjudicator will be expected to give his/her full attention to the performance and to give his/her
undivided attention to evaluating the selection being performed.<u><b> All personal electronic devices
shall be turned off or set to silent mode (no vibration)</b></u>. Adjudicators are <font color="red">not </font>to discuss the evaluation process including, but not limited to: the participation, ratings, quality of performances,
etc. by any means or at any time. This professional discretion is further extended to all manner of
social media, including, but not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, My Space and Snap Chat.
Additionally, adjudicators will make every effort to avoid the appearance of impropriety on the day
of the festival by preventing communication with familiar students or parents in or around the
facility. Adjudicators are instructed to inform any person approaching them that they have been
requested to advise such person of this regulation and to report any person who does so to the
festival manager. <u><b>Adjudicators are<font color="red"> not </font>to verbally <font color="blue">instruct, coach, or clinic </font>students or directors <font color="seafoam">before, during or after</font> performances.</b></u><br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">E.</font></b> Adjudicators shall <font color="red"><b>not</font></b> be bound as to any number of<font color="blue"> “Exemplary”</font> (Division 1) ratings to be given in an event, nor shall they be bound to give an<font color="blue"> “Exemplary”</font> rating in any event. Only those performances that are considered worthy of distinction and among the very best should be givenan<font color="blue"> “Exemplary”</font> rating.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">F.</font></b> Adjudicators should <b><font color="red">not</font></b> interfere with nor assume the duties of the room monitor or time keeper.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">G.</font></b> Adjudicator must <b><font color="red">not</font></b> stop a participant for any reason during a performance <b>except</b> if the performance exceeds the maximum time limit.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">H.</font></b> When less than an<b><font color="blue"> “Exemplary”</font></b> rating is awarded, the adjudicator shall explain on the evaluation sheet what the student or group needs to do to improve their performance. Make positive as well
as negative comments; be sure that comments support the rating given. Complete all sections of the evaluation form and sign the form. Use Arabic numbers for ratings. <b><font color="red">The use of + and/or - beside a rating is no longer allowed.</font></b> If the judge does <b><font color="red">not</font></b> consider the music selected as being sufficiently challenging, he/she shall recommend numbers that would be more appropriate. Use clear, concise comments but avoid ridicule or sarcasm. <b><font color="blue">Remember the purpose of the festival is to <u>evaluate and encourage</u> students to improve!</font></b><br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">I.</font></b> Remember to use the 3 C’s approach in comments – Compliment, Criticize and Course for
Improvement.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">J.</font></b> <u><b><font color="red" >Adjudicators shall record the rating assigned to each event heard on the room list provided in the judges’ packet and return the form to the district festival manager at the end of the day.</font></b></u><br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">K.</font></b> Each adjudicator selected shall be provided a copy of these instructions and no judge shall be bound by any further instructions which contradict these regulations. <b><u><font color="red" face="interfere">There shall be no deviation or paraphrasing of this information.</font></u></b> Any violations of the regulations contained in the MSHSAA Music Manual shall be reported to the festival manager, who shall in turn report them to the MSHSAA Office.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">L.</font></b> An adjudicator <b><font color="red">shall not</font></b> attempt to recruit high school music students participating in district  or state music festivals in which he/she is acting as adjudicator. The Board of Directors is opposed to any recruiting of high school musicians during the time a festival is in progress due to the possibility that this distraction may affect the student’s performance.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">M.</font></b> Each adjudicator shall arrive at least one-half hour before the first event for a pre-festival
instructional meeting with the festival manager.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">N.</font></b> The attention of each adjudicator is called to the violations and penalties provided under section 8
of the MSHSAA Music Manual.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">O.</font></b> In the large group performances in which three adjudicators are used, the adjudicators shall not
confer in reaching a decision regarding the rating assigned.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">P.</font></b> Evaluation forms shall be picked up beginning one hour after the opening of the event and each
hour thereafter.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">Q.</font></b> Adjudicators shall not criticize students for choice of uniform or dress.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">R.</font></b> Adjudicators shall report any act of discourtesy by a participant, music director, or spectator to the
festival manager, who shall forward the report to the MSHSAA office.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">S.</font></b> Changes in district or state festival schedules shall not be altered without consent of the festival
manager. Unauthorized changes are subject to disqualification for the entry involved.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">T.</font></b> Adjudicators should be aware that all performances are open to the public except sight reading.
Requests by any party to clear the performance room cannot be honored.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">U.</font></b> Today you will evaluate many performances. Some performances will be well prepared and meet
the criteria of an “Exemplary” rating while others will fall short. You are to judge and evaluate each
performance based upon the performance heard today. Judge what you hear. Do NOT judge
intent! If a student does not perform “Exemplary” today, do not give a "1". It may be obvious that
you are listening to an exemplary musician; however that does not necessarily mean that you are
listening to an exemplary performance. Rate the performance that you hear.
<b><u><font color="blue">DO NOT ASSIGN A DIVISION I (EXEMPLARY) RATING TO A PERFORMANCE THAT IS CAPABLE OF
RECEIVING A DIVISION I AT STATE BUT CLEARLY DID NOT PERFORM AT THIS LEVEL TODAY.</font></u></b>
Judges are to approach each performance expecting to hear a “ Satisfactory” performance. As the
performance begins, poise your pencil over the satisfactory column at the top of the form. As the
performance continues, make assessments of the performance by placing a check in the appropriate
column for each of the listed fundamentals. In the middle section, write comments which will help
the student improve those fundamentals indicated as deficient. In the bottom section, indicate
something positive about the performance and also the major problems. The final rating is a
subjective assessment of the performance and not a mathematical average of the items checked at
the top of the form. Remember; approach each performance expecting to hear a “Satisfactory”,
not hoping to give an “Exemplary” rating.<br><br>
Again, remember to use the 3 C’s approach when recording your comments – Compliment, Criticize
and Course for Improvement.<br>
<font style="text-rendering: 50px; "><b><font color="red" size="6">1.</font></b> Exemplary
An exemplary performance that consistently demonstrates true musical expression and few
technical errors. The performance is worthy of the distinction of being recognized as among
the very best.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">2.</font></b> Outstanding
An outstanding performance of distinctive quality yet has minor defects in musical expressions
and fundamental techniques.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">3.</font></b> Satisfactory
A satisfactory performance showing accomplishment and marked promise, but lacking consistency of
musical expression and fundamental technique.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">4.</font></b> Developing
A developing performance indicating room for improvement in consistent musical expression
and fundamental technique. Such a performance would include many technical errors, poor
musical expression and ineffective use of existing instrumental or choral voicing.<br><br>
<b><font size="6" color="red">5.</font></b> Ineffective
An ineffective performance indicating obvious lack of overall preparation.</font>
